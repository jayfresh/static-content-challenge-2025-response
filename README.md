# Static Content Challenge

![Tests](https://github.com/jayfresh/static-content-challenge-2025-response/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)
[![Deployed on Vercel](https://therealsujitk-vercel-badge.vercel.app/?app=static-content-challenge-2025-response)](https://static-content-challenge-2025-response.vercel.app)

## Overview

A modern full-stack JavaScript CMS built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. The application serves markdown content from a file-system-based content structure, with URLs matching the folder structure.

## Features

- üìÅ File-system based routing
- üìù Markdown content support with frontmatter
- üé® Modern, responsive design with dark mode
- üîç Content index with hierarchical navigation
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage
- üöÄ Production-ready with Vercel deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or later
- npm 10.x or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jayfresh/static-content-challenge-2025-response.git
   cd static-content-challenge-2025-response
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the application

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Content Management

### Adding Content

1. Create a new directory in `src/content/` - this will be your URL path
2. Add an `index.md` file in your directory
3. (Optional) Add frontmatter for metadata:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: My Page Title
   ---
   # Content goes here
   ```

### Content Structure

```
src/
  content/
    about-page/
      index.md
    blog/
      june/
        company-update/
          index.md
```

URLs will match this structure (e.g., `/about-page`, `/blog/june/company-update`)

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Content**: Markdown with gray-matter and marked
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Hosting**: Vercel

### Key Components

- `[...slug]/page.tsx`: Dynamic route handler
- `lib/markdown.ts`: Content processing utilities
- `lib/content.ts`: Content tree generation
- `components/ContentTree.tsx`: Navigation component

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel:

1. Fork this repository
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Deploy

Environment variables are not required for basic setup.

## Development

### Adding Features

1. **New Component**:
   - Add to `src/components/`
   - Include tests in `src/__tests__/`

2. **Content Processing**:
   - Extend `lib/markdown.ts`
   - Update tests accordingly

3. **Styling**:
   - Add Tailwind classes
   - Modify `globals.css` for custom styles

### Testing

- Unit tests: `npm test`
- Watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
- Coverage report: Available in `/coverage`

## Production Considerations

- ‚úÖ TypeScript for type safety
- ‚úÖ Automated testing
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline
- ‚úÖ Production hosting
- ‚úÖ Dark mode support
- ‚úÖ Responsive design
- ‚úÖ Error handling
- ‚úÖ SEO optimization

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:

1. Search functionality
2. Content preview
3. Image optimization
4. Content validation
5. Breadcrumb navigation
6. RSS feed generation
7. Sitemap generation
8. Content caching

Original challenge brief follows:

**NB: Please do not fork this repository, to avoid your solution being visible from this repository's GitHub page. Please clone this repository and submit your solution as a separate repository.**

Business Scenario: Acme Co's marketing department want a simple content management system and you've been tasked with building the MVP.

The challenge here is to create a full-stack JavaScript application that returns webpages at URLs that match the paths of the folders and sub-folders in the `content` folder. The content of these pages should come from a combination of the template HTML file and a markdown file containing the content.

For example, for a folder called `about-page`, a request to `/about-page` would return a HTML page created from the `template.html` template and the `about-page/index.md` content file. The `template.html` file contains a `{{content}}` placeholder that would be replaced by the content for each page. A request to `/blog/june/company-update` would return a HTML page using the content file at `blog/june/company-update/index.md`.

As a modern full-stack JavaScript app MVP, the application should use an effective mix of technologies, although there is a requirement to use React on the front-end to fit in with Acme Co's other websites.

Acme's marketing department should be able to add extra folders to the `content` folder and the application should work with those without any requiring any code changes.

This repository contains a `template.html` template file and a sample `content` folder with sub-folders containing `index.md` markdown files (or other sub-folders).

Your application may make use of open-source code libraries and other third-party tools. It is entirely up to you how the application performs the challenge. As the use of LLMs is widespread in software engineering, you are permitted to use AI as you wish.

## Testing

The application should be shipped with at minimum three tests, although your testing strategy should effectively test your application:

- one that verifies that requests to valid URLs return a 200 HTTP status code
- one that verifies that requests to valid URLs return a body that contains the HTML generated from the relevant `index.md` markdown file
- one that verifies that requests to URLs that do not match content folders return a 404 HTTP status code
- NB: the tests should not depend on the existing sub-folders in the `content` folder, so the tests do not break as the content changes

## Bonus credit

**NB: This is only relevant if completing this task in your own time, i.e. NOT in a pairing interview**

In this MVP sprint, there are several opportunities to deliver nice-to-have tickets. The marketing team recognise that in a post-LLM world sprint velocity may be higher.

- The generated HTML page should be styled in a pleasing way
- The MVP's GitHub repository should be configured for hosting on a cloud hosting service, and include a link to a live deployment
- The repository should include documentation describing how to both use the application and how to iterate it from here
- Overall, you should do everything you think is necessary to make this application MVP production-ready
